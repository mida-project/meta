[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3172/badge?style=flat-square)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3172)

The goal of this project is to propose a new methodology for fully automated breast cancer detection and segmentation from multi-modal medical images introducing clinical covariates. This protocol provides the following novelties. First, it lies on the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that will incorporate several image modalities: 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI), ultrasound (US) or Mammography (MG) views. This is the first methodology that is able to classify a whole exam, containing all the above image modalities.

In this project, we are interested to develop a new assistant (i.e. a system that will provide diagnosis support as a second opinion), for other human tissues, besides the breast. This will embrace other anatomies such as the aorta, spinal column, epicardial fat, body fat, heart, lungs, and muscle.

## Research

Like the fact that these projects are research projects, we underline and ask for the support of our noble scientific community to help us across the path. With this project, we hope to provide valuable information regarding our research topics and theories. Also, you can follow and support our project on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Medical-Imaging-Diagnosis-Assistant).

## Introduction

Medical Imaging Diagnosis Assistant (MIDA) Project involves the collaborative effort of two Portuguese Research Institutions: [ISR](http://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/)/[IST](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) and [ITI](https://iti.larsys.pt/). This project proposes the development of a methodology for breast detection and cancer targeting using *AI-Assistance* for Medical Imaging (MI) technologies. In short, it will be the development of an *Assistant* for the diagnosis of cancer pathologies based Medical Imaging (MI) technologies.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to research and develop an assistant supporting clinicians (e.g. Physicians, Doctors or Radiologists) on a Medical Imaging (MI) diagnosis, in the context of applied Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to Health Informatics (HI). In particular, we aim at collecting the expert annotations in big data. In order to reach these goals, we need to study the user's experience with our Interactive Machine Learning (iML) system as a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) approach while applying User Research (UR) methods, like the User-Centered Design (UCD) approach, involving end-users on the system development. The working practice of clinicians is, therefore, to determine how to adapt their workflow to a new recommendation system for the medical imaging diagnosis. It is crucial to understand how our system can be introduced into the workflow of clinicians, helping them to effectively do the patient's diagnostic. Furthermore, we need to understand the impact of our system in terms of promoting accurate diagnostic and the right patient care. The knowledge and findings from these studies, as well as, from the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA), will allow us to create and evaluate new HCI and HI practices and distil findings and guidelines for clinicians experts to use. Moreover, understanding best practices and design patterns and establish guidelines is impactful to the healthcare industry, as richer, appealing and well designed recommendation systems are crucial to a solid foundation of HCI applied to HI. As a *proof-of-concept*, it is intended to develop an *Assistant* for monitoring and diagnosis of breast lesions in various MI modalities.

Imaging modalities to include in the work are:

* [Mammography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography) (including the views caudal-skull and oblique);
* [Ultrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound);
* [MRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) volumes;
